## Warning!

Indeed's [robots.txtfile](https://www.indeed.com/robots.txt)  allows for crawlers to parse lists of /jobs but **NOT** job pages like /viewjob?.

to bypass these bot rules, set 'ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = False' in settings.py

Should you do this, be careful not to flood the server with requests. always sleep() before performing a disallowed request.
